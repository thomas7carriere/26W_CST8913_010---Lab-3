Lab 03 - Advanced Concept

The purpose of Lab 3 is to investigate a theoretical mid-sized retail company that uses several on-prem services to run their web application, and explore different approaches using IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS to migrate these services to cloud services. The current on-prem solutions are analyzed to provide an understanding of how the company's system functions using their on-prem services, and a diagram of the current system is made. Potential changes to the services are then considered.

Migration strategies for each of the components of the system were made to determine a plan for how these services can be migrated to the cloud, culminating in a migration plan that the company can employ to successfully migrate the services to the cloud while minimizing risk.

These tasks help us to conceptually understand how cloud architectures can be used for existing businesses to decrease the overhead of the company, while providing all the benefits that cloud services offer.
